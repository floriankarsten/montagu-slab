<p>Montagu Slab is a slab-serif display typeface, drawing inspiration from 19th-century classic designs. The typeface is available as a variable font with weight and optical size axes.</p>

<p>The optical size axis, which controls x-height, spacing, contrast and aperture, provides a wide range of variation â€“ from low contrast and higher x-height version suitable for longer text, to a tight and high contrast display variant with prominent upturned tails.</p>
