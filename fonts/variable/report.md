<summary>‚ö† <b>WARN:</b> Is the command `ftxvalidator` (Apple Font Tool Suite) available?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/ftxvalidator_is_available](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/universal.html#com.google.fonts/check/ftxvalidator_is_available)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
There&#x27;s no reasonable (and legal) way to run the command `ftxvalidator` of the
Apple Font Tool Suite on a non-macOS machine. I.e. on GNU+Linux or Windows etc.
If Font Bakery is not running on an OSX machine, the machine running Font Bakery
could access `ftxvalidator` on OSX, e.g. via ssh or a remote procedure call
(rpc).
There&#x27;s an ssh example implementation at:
https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery/blob/main/prebuilt/workarounds
/ftxvalidator/ssh-implementation/ftxvalidator</pre>

* ‚ö† **WARN** Could not find ftxvalidator. [code: ftxvalidator-available]

<summary>‚ö† <b>WARN:</b> Is there kerning info for non-ligated sequences?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/kerning_for_non_ligated_sequences](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/kerning_for_non_ligated_sequences)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
Fonts with ligatures should have kerning on the corresponding non-ligated
sequences for text where ligatures aren&#x27;t used (eg
https://github.com/impallari/Raleway/issues/14).</pre>

* ‚ö† **WARN** GPOS table lacks kerning info for the following non-ligated sequences:
	- f + f
	- f + b
	- b + f
	- f + h
	- h + f
	- f + i
	- i + f
	- f + k
	- k + f
	- f + l
	- l + b
	- h + i
	- i + k
	- k + l
	- l + t
	- t + t

<summary>‚ö† <b>WARN:</b> The variable font 'opsz' (Optical Size) axis coordinate should be between 10 and 16 on the 'Regular' instance.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/varfont/regular_opsz_coord](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/fvar.html#com.google.fonts/check/varfont/regular_opsz_coord)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
According to the Open-Type spec&#x27;s registered design-variation tag &#x27;opsz&#x27;
available at
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/typography/opentype/spec/dvaraxistag_opsz
If a variable font has an &#x27;opsz&#x27; (Optical Size) axis, then the coordinate of its
&#x27;Regular&#x27; instance is recommended to be a value in the range 10 to 16.</pre>

* ‚ö† **WARN** The "opsz" (Optical Size) coordinate on the "Regular" instance is recommended to be a value in the range 10 to 16. Got 144.0 instead. [code: out-of-range]

<summary>‚ö† <b>WARN:</b> Are there any misaligned on-curve points?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/outline_alignment_miss](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/<Section: Outline Correctness Checks>.html#com.google.fonts/check/outline_alignment_miss)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
This check heuristically looks for on-curve points which are close to, but do
not sit on, significant boundary coordinates. For example, a point which has a
Y-coordinate of 1 or -1 might be a misplaced baseline point. As well as the
baseline, here we also check for points near the x-height (but only for lower
case Latin letters), cap-height, ascender and descender Y coordinates.
Not all such misaligned curve points are a mistake, and sometimes the design may
call for points in locations near the boundaries. As this check is liable to
generate significant numbers of false positives, it will pass if there are more
than 100 reported misalignments.</pre>

* ‚ö† **WARN** The following glyphs have on-curve points which have potentially incorrect y coordinates:
	* uni1EB2: X=535.0,Y=981.5 (should be at ascender 982?)
	* uni1EA8: X=643.5,Y=981.0 (should be at ascender 982?)
	* uni1EA8: X=585.0,Y=983.0 (should be at ascender 982?)
	* uni1EA8: X=587.5,Y=983.5 (should be at ascender 982?)
	* uni1EC2: X=596.5,Y=981.0 (should be at ascender 982?)
	* uni1EC2: X=538.0,Y=983.0 (should be at ascender 982?)
	* uni1EC2: X=540.5,Y=983.5 (should be at ascender 982?)
	* uni1ED4: X=648.5,Y=981.0 (should be at ascender 982?)
	* uni1ED4: X=590.0,Y=983.0 (should be at ascender 982?)
	* uni1ED4: X=592.5,Y=983.5 (should be at ascender 982?) and 46 more. [code: found-misalignments]
