# Montagu Slab

Montagu Slab is a slab-serif display typeface, drawing inspiration from 19th-century classic designs. The typeface is available as a variable font with weight and optical size axes.

The optical size axis, which controls x-height, spacing, contrast and aperture, provides a wide range of variation â€“ from low contrast and higher x-height version suitable for longer text, to a tight and high contrast display variant with prominent upturned tails.

## Pre-building the Fonts

If you want to make a contribution and generate new fonts, before building them, it is necessary to decompose all smart components inside the Glyphs app.

First, install "Montagu Slab Pre-build.py" script placed in "sources/glyphs-decomposed". To do so, open Glyphs app and do the following:

1. Shift+Cmd+Y (Script > Open Scripts Folder)
2. Place "Montagu Slab Pre-build.py" file into the "Scripts" folder
3. Quit Glyphs app

Pre-build process:

1. Duplicate "Montagu-Slab.glyphs" placed in "sources/glyphs-origin" into "sources/glyphs-decomposed"
2. Open the duplicated `glyphs-decomposed` file in Glyphs app
3. Cmd+A (Edit > Select All)
4. Run "Montagu Slab Pre-build" from Script menu
5. Save file

Tested with Glyphs v2.6.6

## Building the Fonts

Family is built using fontmake and gftools post processing script. Tools are all python based.

To install all the Python tools into a virtualenv, do the following :

```
#Create the virtualenv. This step is only required once
python3 -m venv venv 

#Activate the virtualenv. This step is needed every time before building new fonts
source venv/bin/activate 

#Installing required dependencies. This step is only required when creating the venv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the build script in the terminal:

```
cd sources
sh build.sh
```
