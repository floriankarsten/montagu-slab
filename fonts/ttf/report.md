<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Is the command `ftxvalidator` (Apple Font Tool Suite) available?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/ftxvalidator_is_available](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/universal.html#com.google.fonts/check/ftxvalidator_is_available)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

There&#x27;s no reasonable (and legal) way to run the command `ftxvalidator` of the
Apple Font Tool Suite on a non-macOS machine. I.e. on GNU+Linux or Windows etc.

If Font Bakery is not running on an OSX machine, the machine running Font
Bakery could access `ftxvalidator` on OSX, e.g. via ssh or a remote procedure
call (rpc).

There&#x27;s an ssh example implementation at:
https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery/blob/master/prebuilt/workarounds
/ftxvalidator/ssh-implementation/ftxvalidator


</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** Could not find ftxvalidator.

<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Is there kerning info for non-ligated sequences?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/kerning_for_non_ligated_sequences](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/kerning_for_non_ligated_sequences)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

Fonts with ligatures should have kerning on the corresponding non-ligated
sequences for text where ligatures aren&#x27;t used (eg
https://github.com/impallari/Raleway/issues/14).


</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** GPOS table lacks kerning info for the following non-ligated sequences:
	- f + f
	- f + i
	- i + f
	- f + l
	- l + f
	- i + l

<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> The variable font 'opsz' (Optical Size) axis coordinate should be between 9 and 13 on the 'Regular' instance.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/varfont/regular_opsz_coord](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/fvar.html#com.google.fonts/check/varfont/regular_opsz_coord)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

According to the Open-Type spec&#x27;s registered design-variation tag &#x27;opsz&#x27;
available at
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/typography/opentype/spec/dvaraxistag_opsz

If a variable font has a &#x27;opsz&#x27; (Optical Size) axis, then the coordinate of its
&#x27;Regular&#x27; instance is recommended to be a value in the range 9 to 13.


</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** The "opsz" (Optical Size) coordinate on the "Regular" instance is recommended to be a value in the range 9 to 13. Got 144.0 instead. [code: out-of-range]

<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Are there any misaligned on-curve points?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/outline_alignment_miss](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/<Section: Outline Correctness Checks>.html#com.google.fonts/check/outline_alignment_miss)
<pre>--- Rationale ---

This test heuristically looks for on-curve points which are close to, but do
not sit on, significant boundary coordinates. For example, a point which has a
Y-coordinate of 1 or -1 might be a misplaced baseline point. As well as the
baseline, the test also checks for points near the x-height (but only for lower
case Latin letters), cap-height, ascender and descender Y coordinates.

Not all such misaligned curve points are a mistake, and sometimes the design
may call for points in locations near the boundaries. As this test is liable to
generate significant numbers of false positives, the test will pass if there
are more than 100 reported misalignments.


</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** The following glyphs have on-curve points which have potentially incorrect y coordinates:
	* Cdotaccent: X=619.0,Y=1798.0 (should be at ascender 1800?)
	* Cdotaccent: X=1051.0,Y=1798.0 (should be at ascender 1800?)
	* Edotaccent: X=572.0,Y=1798.0 (should be at ascender 1800?)
	* Edotaccent: X=1004.0,Y=1798.0 (should be at ascender 1800?)
	* Gdotaccent: X=631.0,Y=1798.0 (should be at ascender 1800?)
	* Gdotaccent: X=1063.0,Y=1798.0 (should be at ascender 1800?)
	* Idotaccent: X=238.0,Y=1798.0 (should be at ascender 1800?)
	* Idotaccent: X=670.0,Y=1798.0 (should be at ascender 1800?)
	* uni1E44: X=669.0,Y=1798.0 (should be at ascender 1800?)
	* uni1E44: X=1101.0,Y=1798.0 (should be at ascender 1800?) and 41 more. [code: found-misalignments]
