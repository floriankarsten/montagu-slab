<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Is the command `ftxvalidator` (Apple Font Tool Suite) available?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/ftxvalidator_is_available](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/universal.html#com.google.fonts/check/ftxvalidator_is_available)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
There&#x27;s no reasonable (and legal) way to run the command `ftxvalidator` of the
Apple Font Tool Suite on a non-macOS machine. I.e. on GNU+Linux or Windows etc.
If Font Bakery is not running on an OSX machine, the machine running Font Bakery
could access `ftxvalidator` on OSX, e.g. via ssh or a remote procedure call
(rpc).
There&#x27;s an ssh example implementation at:
https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery/blob/main/prebuilt/workarounds
/ftxvalidator/ssh-implementation/ftxvalidator</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** Could not find ftxvalidator. [code: ftxvalidator-available]

<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Is there kerning info for non-ligated sequences?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/kerning_for_non_ligated_sequences](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/kerning_for_non_ligated_sequences)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
Fonts with ligatures should have kerning on the corresponding non-ligated
sequences for text where ligatures aren&#x27;t used (eg
https://github.com/impallari/Raleway/issues/14).</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** GPOS table lacks kerning info for the following non-ligated sequences:
	- f + f
	- f + b
	- b + f
	- f + h
	- h + f
	- f + i
	- i + f
	- f + k
	- k + f
	- f + l
	- l + b
	- h + i
	- i + k
	- k + l

<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Ensure fonts have ScriptLangTags declared on the 'meta' table.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/meta/script_lang_tags](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/meta/script_lang_tags)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
The OpenType &#x27;meta&#x27; table originated at Apple. Microsoft added it to OT with
just two DataMap records:
- dlng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font is designed for
- slng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font supports
The slng structure is intended to describe which languages and scripts the font
overall supports. For example, a Traditional Chinese font that also contains
Latin characters, can indicate Hant,Latn, showing that it supports Hant, the
Traditional Chinese variant of the Hani script, and it also supports the Latn
script
The dlng structure is far more interesting. A font may contain various glyphs,
but only a particular subset of the glyphs may be truly &quot;leading&quot; in the design,
while other glyphs may have been included for technical reasons. Such a
Traditional Chinese font could only list Hant there, showing that it’s designed
for Traditional Chinese, but the font would omit Latn, because the developers
don’t think the font is really recommended for purely Latin-script use.
The tags used in the structures can comprise just script, or also language and
script. For example, if a font has Bulgarian Cyrillic alternates in the locl
feature for the cyrl BGR OT languagesystem, it could also indicate in dlng
explicitly that it supports bul-Cyrl. (Note that the scripts and languages in
meta use the ISO language and script codes, not the OpenType ones).
This check ensures that the font has the meta table containing the slng and dlng
structures.
All families in the Google Fonts collection should contain the &#x27;meta&#x27; table.
Windows 10 already uses it when deciding on which fonts to fall back to. The
Google Fonts API and also other environments could use the data for smarter
filtering. Most importantly, those entries should be added to the Noto fonts.
In the font making process, some environments store this data in external files
already. But the meta table provides a convenient way to store this inside the
font file, so some tools may add the data, and unrelated tools may read this
data. This makes the solution much more portable and universal.</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This font file does not have a 'meta' table. [code: lacks-meta-table]

<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Does the font have a DSIG table?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/dsig](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/dsig.html#com.google.fonts/check/dsig)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
Microsoft Office 2013 and below products expect fonts to have a digital
signature declared in a DSIG table in order to implement OpenType features. The
EOL date for Microsoft Office 2013 products is 4/11/2023. This issue does not
impact Microsoft Office 2016 and above products.
As we approach the EOL date, it is now considered better to completely remove
the table.
But if you still want your font to support OpenType features on Office 2013,
then you may find it handy to add a fake signature on a dummy DSIG table by
running one of the helper scripts provided at
https://github.com/googlefonts/gftools
Reference: https://github.com/googlefonts/fontbakery/issues/1845</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This font has a digital signature (DSIG table) which is only required - even if only a dummy placeholder - on old programs like MS Office 2013 in order to work properly.
The current recommendation is to completely remove the DSIG table. [code: found-DSIG]

<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> The variable font 'opsz' (Optical Size) axis coordinate should be between 10 and 16 on the 'Regular' instance.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/varfont/regular_opsz_coord](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/fvar.html#com.google.fonts/check/varfont/regular_opsz_coord)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
According to the Open-Type spec&#x27;s registered design-variation tag &#x27;opsz&#x27;
available at
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/typography/opentype/spec/dvaraxistag_opsz
If a variable font has an &#x27;opsz&#x27; (Optical Size) axis, then the coordinate of its
&#x27;Regular&#x27; instance is recommended to be a value in the range 10 to 16.</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** The "opsz" (Optical Size) coordinate on the "Regular" instance is recommended to be a value in the range 10 to 16. Got 144.0 instead. [code: out-of-range]

<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Are there any misaligned on-curve points?</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/outline_alignment_miss](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/<Section: Outline Correctness Checks>.html#com.google.fonts/check/outline_alignment_miss)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
This check heuristically looks for on-curve points which are close to, but do
not sit on, significant boundary coordinates. For example, a point which has a
Y-coordinate of 1 or -1 might be a misplaced baseline point. As well as the
baseline, here we also check for points near the x-height (but only for lower
case Latin letters), cap-height, ascender and descender Y coordinates.
Not all such misaligned curve points are a mistake, and sometimes the design may
call for points in locations near the boundaries. As this check is liable to
generate significant numbers of false positives, it will pass if there are more
than 100 reported misalignments.</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** The following glyphs have on-curve points which have potentially incorrect y coordinates:
	* six (U+0036): X=453.0,Y=682.5 (should be at cap-height 682?)
	* nine (U+0039): X=217.5,Y=-0.5 (should be at baseline 0?)
	* f (U+0066): X=497.5,Y=681.5 (should be at cap-height 682?)
	* atilde (U+00E3): X=311.0,Y=680.0 (should be at cap-height 682?)
	* atilde (U+00E3): X=311.0,Y=680.0 (should be at cap-height 682?)
	* ntilde (U+00F1): X=341.0,Y=680.0 (should be at cap-height 682?)
	* ntilde (U+00F1): X=341.0,Y=680.0 (should be at cap-height 682?)
	* otilde (U+00F5): X=325.0,Y=680.0 (should be at cap-height 682?)
	* otilde (U+00F5): X=325.0,Y=680.0 (should be at cap-height 682?)
	* itilde (U+0129): X=190.0,Y=680.0 (should be at cap-height 682?) and 42 more. [code: found-misalignments]
